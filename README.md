> Easily mark (without hiding!) your YouTube subscriptions.

This extension lets you <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>CLICK</kbd> video thumbnails on your [subscriptions feed](https://youtube.com/feed/subscriptions) to toggle tinting them a darker shade of color. Useful for people that have a lot of subscriptions and like making their own visual cues.

Note that the extension works only when you go to your sub feed directly (e.g. via bookmark).

* ✅ **Custom colors** - Customize the color you want videos to be tinted with!
